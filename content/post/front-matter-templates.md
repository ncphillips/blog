<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Does the following sound familiar? </span>

<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">You set up a WP site, hand it off to a non-dev, show them how to edit stuff and then this happens:</span>

They point to some unused part of the UI and say:

> "What does this do?"

To which you reply:

> "Oh that doesn't do anything...just ignore it"

Our goal is to build the dream CMS for developers. A CMS that's customizable and allows you to strip out non-essential clutter from your UI.  <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Today we're announcing the foundation for this: </span>[Front Matter Templates](https://forestry.io/docs/setting-up-a-site/front-matter-templates/) <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">(FMTs).</span>

If you have a page with a complex layout.

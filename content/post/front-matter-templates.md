<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Does the following sound familiar? </span>

<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">You set up a WP site, hand it off to a non-dev friend, show them how to edit stuff and then this happens:</span>

They point to some random part of the UI that doesn't really belong and say <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;"> "why is this thing here?"...to which you reply "oh, just ignore that" :|</span>

Our goal is to build a developer's dream CMS. A completely hackable CMS that works with how we build sites today. 

Today we're announcing the foundation for a customizable CMS.  Front Matter Templates.

As developers, we want to set up our CMS  sites so our non-technical friends have no problems when their editing content.

We all love working with Markdown but one of it's biggest limitations is adding images to your content.  That's why we're happy to announce the [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io) Media Manager.  [Nolan](https://twitter.com/ncphi) and <a href="https://twitter.com/nichlaswa" class="">Nichlas</a> put a lot of work into crafting an amazing UX for this, so we hope you like it ![](/blog/images/fist-pump.png)

## Manage other files


Also manage non-image files like PDFs, text files, etc.

## Hold *shift* to select multiple images


Want to select multiple images at once? Just click on one, then hold Shift and click on another image. This will select all images between the two.

We're happy to announce some huge improvements toÂ [Forestry.io](http://Forestry.io), our CMS for Jekyll and Hugo sites.

Before I outline what's new, I want to thank everyone who has been testing this while it was in beta (you know who you are). Your help was crucial and we're going to continue to build an awesome CMS that you love. ðŸ‘Š

## What's new:

### New Editor

Inspired by [Medium.com](http://Medium.com), we rebuilt the editor.

*   Flip between Markdown (or HTML) and WYSIWYG.
*   Drag images right into the editor
*   Clean design

Here's a screenshot of the post I'm writing (how meta).

Thanks to [@envygeeks](https://envygeeks.io/)Â for all of his hard work on this.

### Re-Designed UI

Our UI has been completely redesigned and is now mobile friendly. Â We're not going to stop until this is the slickest CMS on the planet. Thanks to [Nichlas's](https://twitter.com/nichlaswa) amazing design chops here:

### Forestry Remote

Now you can install Forestry on your site like: [my-site.com/admin/](http://my-site.com/admin/). We think this is pretty cool. It's like WordPress, but in a single HTML file that you deploy to your static site. Note: this is a paid feature, but comes with a trial if you want to kick the tires.

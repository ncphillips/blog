			<h2></h2>

			

<p>When it comes to the Internet, content is king. A site that has well written content concisely tells the story behind a brand, helps to inform customers about a business&rsquo; products or services and helps guide a user navigate to the information that they seek.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with various organizations in helping them choose the technology that is used to publish content onto their sites. When it came down to making a choice, the publishing platform options were often slimmed down by the need for non-technical users to easily publish content.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written on <a href="https://michaelsoolee.com">my personal site</a> for several years using a static-site generator called Jekyll. It’s my go-to choice for publishing content on my site. What a static-site generator does is simply takes text files — think plain .txt or even markdown files — wraps them in a template and converts them into static HTML pages.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve never used a static-site generator, you might be wondering at this point, what are the benefits of using a static-site generator over a more traditional content management system (CMS) like Wordpress or Drupal?</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>

<p>Let me list a few of the benefits that has me hooked on static-site generators:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>There is no database.</strong> All your posts are simple text files, which means there is no need for a database. No database means, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about data corruption and moving your data is a lot easier. Heck you can even stick your text files up on Dropbox and you&rsquo;ll have them with you all the time.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t have to worry about viruses.</strong> Your site is generated entirely on your machine. For this reason, there is no outdated code to worry about or the need to worry about downloading the latest version of a plugin. Just publish and rest easy at night.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Cost to host is cheap.</strong> Since all you&rsquo;re hosting are static assets, the cost to host is super cheap. I&rsquo;m currently hosting on Digital Ocean, a service that provides VPS hosting run on SSDs, so it is blazing fast. Cost to host per month, just $5 dollars. And that includes SSL since I use <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">letsencrypt</a> on the server.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If $5 is still steep, you could even host your site on Amazon&rsquo;s AWS and your monthly bill will be cents. You read that right, cents! Pair that with their CDN service and you&rsquo;ve got yourself a killer hosting solution.</p>

<p>And if that’s still too much, save your spare change for pizza and host your site on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> completely free!</p>

<h2 id="the-not-so-good">The Not So Good</h2>

<p>Are you saying, hey that sounds awesome! Sign me up? Well before you jump the gun and hail static-site generators as your go-to content management solution, let me share some of the roadblocks for static-site generators and afterwards share how these roadblocks are quickly fading with a happy ending.</p>

<p><img src="https://forestry.io/blog/forestryio/images/s_014709C68DCDF8BD80F107957FB4E50CA386A18CEB650506B2E665212EA1F89F_1471055146622_save-draft-publish.gif" class="right small">- <strong>Friction to produce content.</strong> As awesome as static-site generators are, there is friction to creating content. On a traditional publishing platform, you log in, click a few buttons and you&rsquo;re presented with a text box to write your content and publish.</p>

<p>With static-site generators, you have to create a file that will be used for your page or blog post, after writing your content, you&rsquo;ll have to build the entire website, then push up your site to your host. If you&rsquo;re versioning your site — you are versioning your site right? — that adds a few more steps; you have to commit your post, push it to the repo and then have your host server build your site.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Technical by nature.</strong> As pointed out above, you have to be a little tech savvy to run a site with a static-site generator. But you&rsquo;re saying often content creators aren&rsquo;t technically savvy at all&hellip;they&rsquo;re writers and marketers. The learning curve is too steep to get them onboard with using a static-site generator.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>It isn&rsquo;t sexy.</strong> To be honest, as someone using a static-site generator, I&rsquo;ll tell you compared to their CMS counterparts, they just aren&rsquo;t sexy. I&rsquo;m often in my command-line or text editor of choice, both of which are great for coding and stuff. But isn&rsquo;t so conducive to writing.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-happy-ending">The Happy Ending</h2>

<p>Sorry to burst your bubble a little with the not so good list of things about static-site generators, but like I said earlier, there really is a happy ending. As the title of this post states, I can finally choose static, and I&rsquo;m going to tell you why I&rsquo;m excited about this and why I can finally (still) choose static even with the list of not so good things.</p>

<p>Forestry. Forestry is a CMS for your statically generated sites. Your immediate thoughts might be, great another layer that I need to add to my tech stack. Well hold your horses, let me share with you what you gain from using Forestry.</p>

<p>First you gain the benefits I listed above (here&rsquo;s the link to the list if you need a reminder) for static-site generators, second it remedies the &ldquo;not so good&rdquo; things about static-site generators and if you&rsquo;ve already got a statically generated site, the folks behind Forestry have made it über easy to integrate with Forestry.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No more friction to produce.</strong> With Forestry much like a traditional CMS, users login and are presented with a way to create pages and posts. Once the content is written, they can either save a draft or publish with a click of a button.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the background, Forestry commits the necessary changes to your repo (if you’re using GitHub or Bitbucket) and will deploy your compiled site to your host.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Simple by nature.</strong> If the content creators have ever used any modern content management system, they&rsquo;ll feel right at home. WYSIWYG editor? Check. Asset upload? Check.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Oh so sexy.</strong> Let the screenshot below do the talking here. Just eye-candy. Want more? Take <a href="https://forestry.io">Forestry</a> for a test drive.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://forestry.io/blog/forestryio/images/screenshot-white-matt.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So the next time you&rsquo;re faced with setting up a website or a blog and you don&rsquo;t want to go with the traditional CMS options. You can finally choose the much better technology choice of going with a static-site generator for you, but choose a user-friendly <strong>and</strong> sexy CMS for your content producers with <a href="https://forestry.io">Forestry.io</a>.</p>
